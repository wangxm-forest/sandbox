# Started 18 January 2017 - Cat
## Removing duplicate rows and errors

## An R script to clean the "forcetemp" column of the bud burst data
## Updated 31 Jan 2017 for more cleaning! ##

## As of 31 Jan 2017 this file is now SOURCED from cleanmerge_all.R ##
## So to run this you need to start there ##

# See cleanmerge_all.R for started text #

# Using work from Liz Stebbins
