This is a readme for the clean_responsetime.R file
Built by Dan B, On April 24 2017 to recap response_time cleaning
**indicated should be fixed elsewhere

_______________________________________
respose=1,Negative values in response time: check if these are fixed in later code
"caffarra11b"-fixed (was blank in paper) 
calme94"-fixed (negative, fixed-betula and quercus changed 
"heide12"-fixed (paper says response > 90 days, we re-coded as no response)     
"heide93a"-fixed (paper says response > 50 days, we re-coded as no response) 
"howe95"-fixed (paper says response > 60 days, we re-coded as no response) 
---------------------------------------
1 in response, but resp.varsimple is in %budbust
falusi96- For data from table 2, changed to meandaystostage3(buds scales separated and green tip visible)â€” fixed
ruesink98"- OK
-------------------------------------------
Are 1 in response, but other in respvar.simple 
**cannell83- would need to fix this is respvar by calculating thermal time from figure 3 (check clean_thermaltimetodays.R) Leave this for now, see note about it in ospreexlsx_README.txt
gunderson12- OK, do not change
"heide11"-OK, do not change
"pettersen71"-OK, do not change
"sonsteby13" -OK, do not change

**ghelardini10-cat says this is fine, see her for details ask lizzie about this (check clean_thermaltimetodays.R).. should be fixed in multiresp.R
heide12-fixed
**heide93-cat says this is fine, see her for details ask lizzie about this (check clean_thermaltimetodays.R). will be handled in thermaltime or multiresp code

Overall, I checked 0.377624 rows of the full dataset.
Dataset ID's that still need attention:
cannell83--see note about it in ospreexlsx_README.txt
ghelardini10?-- handled in multiresp.R
heide93-- handeled in in thermaltime or multiresp code
